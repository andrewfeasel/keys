keys: a localized password manager/database written in Bash.

There are words that I am using for the documentation that may not make sense to all users,
so I will explain them here:

tag: a location/domain that can have multiple key/value pairs. Like an array of objects.
Using 'keys get github' would return the key/value (or username/password) of the tag 'github'.

key: An unique identifier with a corresponding value

value: data, or whatever you want it to be.
